# In Silico PCR

The *In Silico* PCR tool is intended as a means of identifying primer binding and possible PCR products in an electronic setting. It is, of course, best used as a screening tool, and not meant as evidence or a guarantee. The products that are seen as output from this tool are hypothetical, and do not account for primer binding affinity or other metrics of PCR success. It is expected that the user will take the results from this tool and further verify the PCR qualities through sites like Primer3.
